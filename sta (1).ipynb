The final simulation demonstrated that swapping increases the chances of winning, with an approximate win rate of 66.74%, which aligns with the theoretical probability.\n",

    "### **Key Points Discussed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Markov Chain Basics:A Markov chain models transitions between states (words) based on previous occurrences.We discussed how to build a chatbot using Markov Chains, which learns word-to-word transitions and generates text based on the learned patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Initial Example: I provided an initial Python implementation of a Markovian chatbot that uses a text corpus to build a transition matrix (word mappings) and generate responses.The chatbot starts with a specified word and generates a sequence of words based on learned probabilities.\n",
    " \n",
    "#3. YouTube Video Mention:You referenced embedding a YouTube video with the ID `'56mGTszb_iM'`, and I provided a simple command using `IPython.display` to embed the video in a notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Expanded Example with Stories:You requested using a series of stories with multiple characters to train the chatbot. The chatbot was then able to generate responses based on these stories, which could be extended to different characters or themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Markov Chain Implementation:The chatbot used a transition matrix (a dictionary where each word maps to a list of possible next words).The response generation process involved randomly selecting the next word based on the previously seen word, as per the Markov model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. Example Output:The chatbot generated sentences starting with a specified word (e.g., \"Arthur\") by continuing with the learned transitions from the stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Code Provided:**\n",
    "#- **Markovian ChatBot Class:** A Python class that uses a Markov chain to learn word transitions from a text and generate new responses.\n",
    "#- **Example Dataset:** A series of stories with characters (Arthur, Drako, Elara, and Jack) to illustrate how the chatbot can be trained on different narratives.\n",
    "#- **Response Generation:** The chatbot generated responses by continuing from a specified starting word.\n",
